The paper extends [SWAY](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8249828), an efficient sampling based baseline search heuristic, to permutative decision space. The preliminary study uses Test Case Prioritisation (TCP) problem to study the feasibility of our theoretical extension, and this repository supports the replication of the study.
