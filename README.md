The paper extends [SWAY](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8249828), an efficient sampling based baseline search heuristic, to permutative decision space. The preliminary study uses Test Case Prioritisation (TCP) problem to study the feasibility of our theoretical extension, and this repository supports the replication of the study.

## Replication

### Comparison of random, greedy, and SWAY
To reproduce results in Fig.2, run the following command:
```console
sh evaluate.sh
```

### Sensitivity test of SWAY to initial sample size
To reproduce results in Fig.3, run the following command:
```console
sh evaluate_initial.sh
```
